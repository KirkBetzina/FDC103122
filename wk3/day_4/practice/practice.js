/*
TO DO APP

1. EASY: First write out the function that will add on to the existing list from the users input.
2. EASY: Create a button at the bottom of the list to clear out the whole list.
3. HARD: With each item that is added, also add a delete button. NOTE: need a running count to keep track of which id element to delete.
4. NIGHTMARE: Using the running count, can you figure out a way to edit the task? NOTE: need to add an edit button
